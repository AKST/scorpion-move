Scorpion Move

For a university related event I was asked to put together something
you can do with canvas. I had trouble putting an interesting presentation
together with just canvas animations, so I ended up making the visualisations
I had made make them react to music. The song I ended up choosing was Zedd's
"Scorpion Move", although originally I had gone with Teknians "1984", but with
my existing visualisations "Scorpion Move" seemed to be a better fit.


## Setting up the visualisation
Zedd released this song for free ages ago, you can get it yourself.
And if you want use it with site do the following.

    cd <project dir>
    mkdir tune
    cp <Scorpion Move.mp3> zedd.mp3

## Different music options

If you're not a Zedd fan it's pretty easy to drop your own music in
following those steps above.
